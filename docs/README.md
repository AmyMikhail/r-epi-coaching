## Overview

This page hosts the R tutorial materials for the **MSF OCA R coaching
series**. This coaching series was developed to support MSF OCA R public
health epidemiology users who have already undertaken some R courses
and/or have some limited experience of R, but are still at an early
stage in their R journey. The materials may also be useful to more
experienced R users who want a quick refresher on how to undertake some
common analytical tasks in R.

### Material source

The content of these sessions is inspired by requests from the coaching
group. The tutorials are written by MSF OCA epidemiology advisors and
tailored to the needs of the group. Each session typically focuses on a
task that one or more members is undertaking during their daily work.
The material for each session includes an R markdown document used to
create a HTML tutorial, which introduces some brief context (a made up
scenario) on which some exercises are based. For each exercise, there is
some example code, followed by a ‘your turn’ section, which invites
users to try the code themselves using different parameters. There are
hint and solution sections at the end of each exercise, which can be
revealed on a click if the users need more guidance.

The coaching sessions are usually run as an online interactive session,
however the materials can also be used independently for self-learning.

### Credits

The style and approach taken by the tutorials follows closely that
presented in the [Epidemiologist R
handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/). For simplicity, in most
sessions we have also used the data sets that accompany the handbook for
the exercises. We gratefully acknowledge and thank the authors of the
**Epidemiologist R handbook** for this invaluable resource.

## How to use this resource

If you would like to try the tutorials, we suggest you do the following:

1.  Make sure you have the latest versions of R, RStudio and Rtools
    installed.
2.  Download the materials pack for the relevant session from the links
    above.
3.  Unzip the folder to a location on your computer (desktop or my
    documents).
4.  Go to the sub-folder `outputs` and click on the HTML file inside it
    (it will open in your internet browser, but does not require an
    internet connection).
5.  Alternately, if you have a good internet connection, you can access
    the tutorials directly online from the links above.
6.  Now open the Rstudio project in the root of the session folder.
7.  Create a new R script for the exercises and save it in the subfolder
    called ‘scripts’.
8.  Follow the introductory section to make sure you have the relevant
    packages installed, loaded and to import the data
9.  Follow the rest of the sections in sequence to undertake the
    exercises (note: exercises are displayed in tabs).
10. If you are stuck, you can click on the arrow next to the *hint* or
    *solution* buttons at the bottom of each exercise to reveal them
